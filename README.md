frogg-crud-generator
====================

Frogg is a lightweight, old-style PHP CRUD generator. Frogg lets you select the database you want, then the tables you
want and Froog makes for you the Create, Retrieve, Update and Delete Forms and Actions to process them in one single 
step. An strong time-saver for PHP developers. With Frogg you are able to have in some minutes a system almost finished.

Frogg do for you the boring and dirty work of design forms and actions to process them. This is an ancient project of 
mine written in PHP5 and procedural style. So, if you want to improve it, there's lots of things to do.
